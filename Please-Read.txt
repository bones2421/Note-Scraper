//Notes about my struggles with this assignment
//My code all seems correct.
//Started over 3 times to make sure
//I have been able to plug in different styling formats just fine and that all renders
//I believe I am connecting to mongoDB correctly
//Looked stuff up and did exactly what they said
//Got help from a TA, helped a little bit but did not slove my problem
//He told me that as long as my scraping code was selecting the right tags on the page, it would pull
//I checked this and there was more to it than that
//The tags I was using did not match the news site I showed him, but they matched the website I was scraping from
//It seems like it is dumping into mongoDB
//The articles still refuse to render to the page, however
//This submission is not going to be good, but it's what I was able to do here
//If I can find time after I submit I will try again on this and hopefully I can get it regraded
//There is something I am missing
//Not sure what that even is at this point
